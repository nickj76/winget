# WinGet
WinGet Repository for implementation of  this solution 



Implementation of Winget over Microsoft Store for Business which is to be depreciated eventually

Objective

To install and remove a default set of applications by using proactive remediation to update these via the same method

Still testing but base code is working


Problems

WinGet will not work on a clean install of Windows 10 or Windows 11.  It requires an upgrade to the Microsoft Store
WinGet has issues with Microsoft.Office been that it will install a x86 version on a x64 platform
WinGet has issues with Microsoft Teams on Windows 11 - a corporate version via Office and the consumer version via default install
Winget has issues with Microsoft OneNote for Windows Desktop and this should be removed in a corporate environment
